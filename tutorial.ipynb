This problem of predicting the result of measurements is\n","called the modelization problem, the simulation problem, the forward\n","problem, or the primal problem. The inverse problem consists of using\n","the actual result of some measurements to infer the values of the\n","parameters that characterize the system. While the forward problem has\n","(in deterministic physics) a unique solution, the inverse problem does\n","not. As an example, consider measurements of the gravity field around a\n","planet: given the distribution of mass inside the planet, we can\n","uniquely predict the values of the gravity field around the planet\n","(forward problem), but there are different distributions of mass that\n","give exactly the same gravity field in the space outside the planet.\n","Therefore, the inverse problem — of inferring the mass distribution from\n","observations of the gravity field — has multiple solutions (in fact, an\n","infinite number). Because of this, in the inverse problem, one needs to\n","make explicit any available a priori information on the model\n","parameters. One also needs to be careful in the representation of the\n","data uncertainties.\n","</blockquote>\n","\n","PDEs can be parametrized to cover a range of different\n","materials / fluids / environment conditions, etc. A problem of recovering\n","certain parameters from the physical observations is called an inverse\n","problem.\n","\n","The history of applying Bayesian statistics to inverse problems dates\n","back to Albert Tarantola.
